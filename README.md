# zomato_analytics
This repository showcases a Zomato Dashboard Analytics project built to visualize restaurant and customer insights. It highlights trends in orders, ratings, and user behavior through interactive dashboards. The goal is to enable clear, data-driven decision-making with engaging visualizations.


# 📊 Zomato Analytics Dashboard  

## Overview  
This repository demonstrates an end‑to‑end analytics project on Zomato data using **Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau**. Each module represents a stage in the analytics workflow — from raw data cleaning to advanced visualization — ensuring that insights are clear, actionable, and business‑ready.

## 📑 Excel Module  

- **Data Import & Cleaning**  
  The raw Zomato dataset is imported into Excel where duplicates are removed, missing values are handled, and column formats are standardized. This step ensures the dataset is reliable and ready for deeper analysis.  

- **Data Preparation**  
  Calculated fields such as revenue, average order value, and customer frequency are created. Cuisines are categorized, and text entries are normalized to maintain consistency across the dataset.  

- **Exploratory Analysis**  
  Pivot tables and descriptive statistics are used to explore customer demographics, restaurant ratings, and order volumes. This helps identify early patterns and anomalies in the data.  

- **KPI Calculation**  
  Key metrics such as total orders, average ratings, top cuisines, and monthly revenue growth are derived. These KPIs form the foundation for performance tracking.  

- **Trend Analysis**  
  Seasonal order patterns, peak ordering times, and customer activity changes are identified. This helps businesses understand demand cycles and plan accordingly.  

- **Visualization**  
  Basic charts (bar, line, pie) are created to present insights clearly. These visuals serve as a quick overview before moving into BI tools for advanced dashboards.

## 🗄️ SQL Module  

- **Database Setup**  
  The Zomato dataset is imported into relational tables. Proper indexing and schema design ensure efficient querying and scalability.  

- **Joins & Relationships**  
  SQL joins are used to connect customers, orders, restaurants, and ratings. This relational mapping allows for comprehensive analysis across multiple dimensions.  

- **Aggregations**  
  Queries calculate total orders, revenue, and average ratings. These aggregations provide a structured view of performance metrics.  

- **Top Performers**  
  SQL queries identify the top restaurants, cuisines, and high‑value customers. This helps highlight areas of success and potential growth.  

- **Trend Queries**  
  Time‑based queries track monthly and weekly order volumes, revealing seasonal demand and customer behavior shifts.  

- **Advanced Queries**  
  Additional queries analyze delivery times, cancellations, and customer retention rates. These insights are critical for operational efficiency.

## 📊 Power BI Module  

- **Dashboard Overview**  
  A central dashboard is created with KPIs and summary cards, offering a quick snapshot of overall performance.  

- **Customer Insights**  
  Interactive visuals highlight demographics, preferences, and repeat customer behavior. Slicers allow filtering by age, location, or cuisine.  

- **Order Trends**  
  Line charts and bar graphs display daily, weekly, and seasonal order patterns. Filters enable users to drill down into specific time frames.  

- **Revenue Analysis**  
  Revenue is broken down by restaurant, cuisine, and time period. KPI cards highlight high‑value customers and profitable segments.  

- **Drill‑Through Reports**  
  Users can click into specific restaurants to view detailed performance metrics, including ratings, reviews, and order counts.  

- **Interactive Features**  
  Slicers, filters, and drill‑downs make the dashboard dynamic, allowing stakeholders to explore data from multiple perspectives.

## 📈 Tableau Module  

- **Visual Storytelling**  
  Tableau dashboards are designed to tell a story with data, using interactive filters and parameters to guide exploration.  

- **Geographical Insights**  
  Heatmaps and geo‑plots show order distribution by city or region, helping identify hotspots and underserved areas.  

- **Trend Lines**  
  Seasonal and monthly order patterns are visualized with trend lines, making it easy to spot growth or decline over time.  

- **Comparative Analysis**  
  Restaurant ratings and performance are compared side‑by‑side, highlighting leaders and laggards in the market.  

- **Customer Behavior**  
  Spending patterns, satisfaction levels, and loyalty metrics are analyzed to understand customer engagement.  

- **Advanced Visuals**  
  Tree maps, bubble charts, and interactive maps provide deeper insights into complex datasets, making Tableau a powerful storytelling tool.
